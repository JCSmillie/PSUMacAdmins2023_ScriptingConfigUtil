# PSUMacAdmins2023_ScriptingConfigUtil
This repo is for the presentation I gave at PSU MacAdmins 2023 on July 20th, 2023.  The basis of this presentation is pretty much how to use cfgutil to script and automate some of the common iPad deployment tasks.  This repo is for any examples given during the presentation as well as the slides.  Post session I will also post any video links as well as other repo linkage.  Thank you.

Shake N Bake is in the Extras folder in MOSBasic.  The version listed is a little older but I will be updating this before school starts again with a newer version.
